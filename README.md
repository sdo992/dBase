History
===============
Early 1990s dBase II/III script - for historical purposes

I was working at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma on the system then called AWACS. Later, I was tasked to go to the part storage to work on pulling network cables through asbestos and fixing this dBase II/III script. I don't know why I printed this out back then (and on a dot matrix printer no less!), but I found it last year in my paperwork looking for something else and thought it would be kind of fun to revisit the code.

I may try to see if I can fix any holes in logic and make it more compact. This was the best in BASIC-style programming that the early 1990s had to offer!
